# Frontend Implementation

This is where you should implement your frontend solution for the take-home challenge.

## Tech Stack Requirements

You must use:
- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

## Backend Connection

Make sure the backend server is running on http://localhost:8888 before starting your frontend development.

```bash
# In a separate terminal
cd ../backend
npm install
npm start
```

## Your Implementation

Replace this README with your own documentation that includes:
- How to install and run your application
- How to run tests
- Key design decisions and architectural choices
- Any assumptions you made
- Optional improvements you'd make with more time

Good luck! 🚀
